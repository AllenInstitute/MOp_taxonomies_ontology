# MOp_taxonomies_ontology
Central location for versioning and sharing of taxonomy files relevant for ontology development as part of cell type cards.

## File summaries
* **landingpage_dataset_info.csv**: additional information on the mouse landing page
* **Taxonomy Info Panel.csv**: general information for the mouse taxonomy
* **cell_set_nomenclature_DATE.csv**: contains the current (as of listed date) cell sets for all BICCN taxonomies (and is a superset of what is in the folders)
* **All Descriptions_Mouse.json**: contains short text descriptions and aliases used to populate cell type cards for the mouse.
* **FOLDER/(all files)**: scripts and associated output files generated for the three single-species taxonomies as described in [the nomenclature repo](https://github.com/AllenInstitute/nomenclature).  These files are used for ontology building and for the cell type taxonomy service

**Reference files in GTF format for each taxonomy are too large to host here and can be found instead in this [shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rOYwiIxGgEolWsO3a-7g6rxUefsXIcKB).**

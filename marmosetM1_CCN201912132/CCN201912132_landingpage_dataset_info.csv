marmoset,M1,,"10x Chromium v2, v3","85,121 nuclei","10x 3' v3 is the third version of the 10x sequencing technology that sequences from the 3' end of nucleic acid molecules. In the 3' assay, the polyd(T) sequence is part of the gel bead oligo (which also contains the 10x barcode, UMI, and partial Illuma Read 1 sequence), with the template switch oligo (TSO) supplied in the RT Primer.",https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-7jxfmkh,https://nemoanalytics.org//index.html?layout_id=ac9863bf
marmoset,M1,,snmC-Seq2,"5,324 nuclei","A single-nucleus sequencing assay (library preparation method) that involves fragmentation of genomic DNA followed by adapter ligation, bisulfite conversion and limited amplification using adapter-specific PCR primers in preparation for sequencing. This enables the genome-wide indentification of cytosine DNA methylation states at single-base resolution.

marmoset,M1,,SNARE-seq2,"9,946 nuclei","A sequencing assay that involves the isolation of single nuclei and open chromatin tagmentation in the isolated nuclei using a transposase. The tagmented nuclei are then encapsulated in a droplet including both an oligo-dT-containing barcoded bead and a splint oligonucleotide, which links the tagmented gDNA fragments to the bead, enabling the bead to capture both mRNAs and open chromatin fragments. After mRNAs and gDNA fragments are released from the bead by heating, RT and PCR amplification are performed to generate a library of cDNA and open chromatin gDNA fragments.

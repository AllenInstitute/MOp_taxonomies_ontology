CCN201912131,117,19,4,Homo sapiens,18-68 years old,Both,BICCN Human Primary Motor Cortex Mini-Atlas,"Welcome to the Cell Types Explorer for our multimodal cell census and atlas of human primary motor cortex (M1), developed in collaboration with the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) and described in detail in [the BICCN flagship publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03950-0). ","The taxonomy is available under the CC BY 4.0 License, and more information from the taxonomy creators is available in [the published paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03465-8). Ontology integration of this taxonomy is described in [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.10.463703v1.full).","The navigational tool on this page is a visual representation of the transcriptomic taxonomy of human M1, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the molecular signatures of cell types comprising this region. Cell types in the taxonomy are grouped and visualized at three different levels: Class (innermost ring), Subclass (middle ring) and Cluster (outermost ring). Clicking on any region in the tool will navigate to an individual Cell Type Card, each of which provides detailed multimodal information describing that cell type and links to underlying data.

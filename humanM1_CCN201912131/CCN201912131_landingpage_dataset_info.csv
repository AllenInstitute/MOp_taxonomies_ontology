human,M1,,SMART-Seq v4,"10,534 nuclei","A single cell sequencing assay wherein the target cells are lysed, and the RNA is hybridized to an oligo(dT)-containing primer. The first strand of the cDNA is synthesized with the addition of a few untemplated C nucleotides. This poly(C) overhang is added exclusively to full-length transcripts. An oligonucleotide primer is hybridized to the poly(C) overhang and used to synthesize the second strand. Full-length cDNAs are PCR-amplified to obtain nanogram amounts of DNA. The PCR products are purified for sequencing. This is the fourth version of the assay.",https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-ci7q9k4,https://celltypes.brain-map.org/rnaseq/human_m1_10x?selectedVisualization=Heatmap&colorByFeature=Cell+Type&colorByFeatureValue=GAD1
human,M1,,"10x Chromium v3, v2","81,755 nuclei","10x 3' v3 is the third version of the 10x sequencing technology that sequences from the 3' end of nucleic acid molecules. In the 3' assay, the polyd(T) sequence is part of the gel bead oligo (which also contains the 10x barcode, UMI, and partial Illuma Read 1 sequence), with the template switch oligo (TSO) supplied in the RT Primer.

human,M1,,Patch-seq,6 cells,"A sequencing assay wherein a patch clamp recording is taken from a neuron and then scRNA sequencing is performed on the cell soma. During recording, the cell is also filled with biocytin dye enabling imaging and reconstruction of cellular morphology.

human,M1,,SNARE-seq2,"84,178 nuclei","A sequencing assay that involves the isolation of single nuclei and open chromatin tagmentation in the isolated nuclei using a transposase. The tagmented nuclei are then encapsulated in a droplet including both an oligo-dT-containing barcoded bead and a splint oligonucleotide, which links the tagmented gDNA fragments to the bead, enabling the bead to capture both mRNAs and open chromatin fragments. After mRNAs and gDNA fragments are released from the bead by heating, RT and PCR amplification are performed to generate a library of cDNA and open chromatin gDNA fragments.

human,M1,,snmC-Seq2,"5,222 nuclei","A single-nucleus sequencing assay (library preparation method) that involves fragmentation of genomic DNA followed by adapter ligation, bisulfite conversion and limited amplification using adapter-specific PCR primers in preparation for sequencing. This enables the genome-wide indentification of cytosine DNA methylation states at single-base resolution.
